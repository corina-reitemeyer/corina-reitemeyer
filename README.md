# Hi there, I'm Corina (she/her)! üëã

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me
I‚Äôm a Senior UX/UI designer and Full Stack Developer with a passion for data analytics, allowing me to create user-centered solutions that are both functional and impactful. With 6-7 years working in tech, I love uncovering the stories that data tells, and crafting experiences that truly resonate with people.

My tech journey kicked off in my teens, sparked by a curiosity for both design and coding. After diving deep into UX/UI design for several years, I decided to pivot toward programming. In March 2024, I jumped into a fast-paced 17-week bootcamp at Dev Academy to specialise in Full Stack Web Development.

Shortly after, I plunged into data analytics to see how I could blend my UX background with my technical skills to uncover valuable insights and create meaningful solutions. It also helps me understand how to effectively derive meaning from data, so that my designs are more informed, measured, and impactful.

I‚Äôm all about best practices and thrive on continuous learning, always eager to embrace new technologies to deliver awesome results. I find joy in tackling challenges, whether it‚Äôs through coding, design, or finding interesting insights and patterns in datasets.
